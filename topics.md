## Floer theory

and see 

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/95407/introduction-to-floer-theory 

e.g.

    Also I should point out that the geometric intuition provided by Andreas Floer in some of his early papers is really quite beautiful and illuminating. For example read the introduction to his 1989 paper, Symplectic Fixed Points and Holomorphic Spheres, in Comm. Math. Phys (120) 575-611.

On symmetries of W and M where W is the boundary of M. The mapping class group of W does not act on M. But knots are an exception:

    "One can embed a knot in S^3 without breaking any symmetries. This is true in a very strong sense: The diffeomorphism group of S^3 is contractible to SO(4) which acts on B^4, consider S^3 to be the boundary of B^4"
