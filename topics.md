On symmetries of W and M where W is the boundary of M. The mapping class group of W does not act on M. But knots are an exception:

    "One can embed a knot in S^3 without breaking any symmetries. This is true in a very strong sense: The diffeomorphism group of S^3 is contractible to SO(4) which acts on B^4, consider S^3 to be the boundary of B^4"
